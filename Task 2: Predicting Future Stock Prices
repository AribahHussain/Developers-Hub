This project focused on predicting the next day's stock price using historical stock market data. I used the yfinance API to retrieve data and selected a stock such as Tesla or Apple. Using features like Open, High, Low, and Volume, I trained regression models (Linear Regression and Random Forest) to predict the Close price. I also visualized the predicted versus actual prices to evaluate model accuracy. It helped me understand time-series modeling and real-world data application.
