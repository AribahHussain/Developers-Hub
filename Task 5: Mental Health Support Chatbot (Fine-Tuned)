In this project, I fine-tuned a pre-trained language model like DistilGPT2 using the EmpatheticDialogues dataset. The goal was to create a chatbot that could respond with emotional awareness and support. I focused on creating a safe, non-judgmental experience for users dealing with stress or anxiety. I also built a simple interface for interacting with the chatbot. This task taught me how AI can be used to provide empathetic conversation.
