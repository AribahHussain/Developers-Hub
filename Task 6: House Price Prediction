This task used a Kaggle housing dataset to predict property prices based on features like area, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and location. I performed feature encoding and scaling, then trained both Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting models. Evaluation was done using MAE and RMSE, and I visualized predicted vs actual values. It was a great hands-on experience in regression modeling and understanding real estate trends.
