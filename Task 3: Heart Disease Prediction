Using the Heart Disease UCI dataset from Kaggle, I built a binary classification model to predict whether a person is at risk of heart disease. After cleaning and exploring the dataset, I trained Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models. I evaluated them using metrics like accuracy, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix. This project taught me how machine learning can assist in healthcare-related predictions while emphasizing ethical considerations.
