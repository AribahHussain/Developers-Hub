In this task, I worked with the Iris dataset to practice basic data exploration and visualization. Using pandas, I loaded the dataset and used commands like .head(), .info(), and .describe() to inspect the data. I created scatter plots, histograms, and box plots with matplotlib and seaborn to better understand the relationships and distributions among features. This task improved my ability to explore and interpret raw data.
