This task involved creating a chatbot using a large language model such as OpenAI GPT-3.5 or Mistral-7B-Instruct. The chatbot could answer basic health-related queries in a safe, conversational way. I applied prompt engineering to shape the chatbotâ€™s tone and responses, and added safety filters to prevent it from giving risky medical advice. This helped me learn about responsible AI use in sensitive domains like health.
